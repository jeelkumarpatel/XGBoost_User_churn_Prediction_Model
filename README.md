# Project Description

Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. Waze partners with cities, transportation authorities, broadcasters, businesses, and first responders to help as many people as possible travel more efficiently and safely. 

I have built RF and XGBoost moels for user churn predictions and compared both models performance wise.

Key insights:  Enhancing the model with new features, such as detailed user behavior and drive-level data, could significantly boost its predictive performance.
